# QA Baseline Screenshots

This directory is used to store baseline screenshots for visual regression testing as part of the QA process.

For each task (e.g., DF-XXX), create a new subdirectory:

/qa/baseline/DF-XXX/

Inside, add the "before" and "after" screenshots as defined in the /docs/qa-checklist.md document.
